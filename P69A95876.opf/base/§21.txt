(The admonition of the Lord to a bodhisattva:) Then the Lord spoke to the boy Ratnadatta:These,
Ratnadatta, are the five kinds of purification of a gift. What five? (atha bhagavān ratnadattaṃ
dārakam āmantrayate sma, pañcemāni ratnadatta bodhisattvasya dakṣiṇāpariśodhanāni,
pañca katamāni, tad yathā): He does not have conceptions of the body (kāyaṃ nopalabhate),
he has no conceptions of the thoughts (cittam nopalabhate), he is not attached to the gift
(dāne ’nabhiniviṣṭaḥ), he wishes no result (vipāke niḥspṛhaḥ), he wishes no result for
the ones receiving the gift (pratigrāhakānām avipākaḥ).And these four things, Ratnadatta,
the bodhisattva should realize. What four? (catvāra ime ratnadatta nityā sākṣātkartavyāḥ,
katamāś catvāraḥ, tad yathā): Concentration on emptiness (śūnyatāsamādhiḥ), recollection
of the Buddha (buddhānusmṛtiḥ), absolute compassion (mahākaruṇā), maturation of own former
actions (svakarmavipāka).
