(On the merit of the teaching:) Then the Lord addressed Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta:Mañjuśrī, if you
compare a bodhisattva who practises the six perfections (ṣaḍpāramitā) in a period of hundred
thousand kalpas without expedient means (upāyakauśalya) with whoever hears this exposition
of religion even with doubt (sakāṅkṣa), then the last mentioned has acquired more merit
(puṇya) than the former.So what shall we say about whoever hears it without doubt (akāṅkṣa)?And
what shall we say about whoever writes it down, whoever reads it, remembers it and
teaches extensively to others?Mañjuśrī, whoever wishes to attain the stage of a a saint
(arhattva) should be trained in this teaching (dharma), whoever wishes to attain isolated
awakening (pratyekabodhi) should be trained in this teaching, and whoever wishes to attain
the incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi) should be trained in this teaching.
