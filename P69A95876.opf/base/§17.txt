(Eight provoked monks:) At that time eight monks (bhikṣu), victims of their preconceptions (aupalambhika)
did not approve of this kind of religious exposition (dharmaparyāya), and left,
going away from that congreagation (parṣad).But warm blood flowed out of their mouths
and they died. Then they were born in the great hell (mahānaraka) Raurava.Then Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta
addressed the Lord: Lord, did you see the great harm that appeared when these monks
had heard this exposition of religion?The Lord said: Do not say that, Mañjuśrī.If these
monks had not heard this exposition of religion, they would never have been born in the good
places of the universe (sugati) in a million kalpas (kalpanayuta), and so, how could they
meet and please a Buddha?Now they will, even though they heard this exposition of religion
with doubt (sakāṅkṣā), be born in the Tuṣita heaven after they have died (cyutvā) in
the great hell Raurava.Then, in sixty-eight kalpas, they will please (ārāgayiṣyanti) ten times
hundred thousand milloins of Tathāgatas, and they will by miraculous birth (aupapāduka)
be born as universal kings (cakravartirāja).And during one kalpa, they will be born as
Tathāgatas, Arhats, Perfect Buddhas with the name Vimalaprabha.
