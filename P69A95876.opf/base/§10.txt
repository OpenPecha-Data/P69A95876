(On the emptiness of any spiritual attainment:) Then the venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana spoke the
following verse to the boy Ratnadatta:

Even if you have given an offering to this teacher with faith (śraddhā), how will you ever become
a Buddha with such a perverted attitude (viparītamati) (1)?Then the boy Ratnadatta spoke
the following verses to the venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana:All these things are unborn (anutpanna),
the composite things (saṃskṛta) are empty (tuccha) and worthless (rikta). So,
among such things (dharma), where is something which really originates (vastuta utpadyate)
(1)?You are clad in the orange monk’s robes (kaṣāyacīvara), and hold on to the role of a
holy man (arhattvaṃ gṛhṇāsi), but is not the consciousness of this [role] (tadvijñāna), as
well as its object (gocara) [viz. the role itself], only empty (śūnya) (2)?The ten millons
Buddhas are not pleased (āragita) by one based on conceptions (upalambha), but if one peacefully
(śānta) regards them, there is not one of the ten millons who are not pleased (ārāgita)
(3).So how can Maudgalyāyana be the victim of such conceptions? You should rather purify
your thoughts (citta) [of preconceptions], whoever the person is making an offering
(4)!
