(Ratnadatta sees the Lord and offers Him a lotus of gold:) Then the boy Ratnadatta told his
nurse: “Put me in the window so that I can see the Tathāgata!” The nurse then put him in the
window.The Lord read the thoughts of Ratnadatta (ratnadattasya dārakasya cetasaiva cetaḥparivitarkam
ājñāya), and went to that lane.The boy Ratnadatta saw the Lord approaching,
and he thought: “Those who do not produce the thought of awakening (bodhicitta) having seen
the Tathāgata with all his qualities (guṇa), are indeed unlucky!”Then the Lord went to the
gate of Ratnadatta. Ratnadatta thought: “Such a remarkable being is difficult to find even
in hundred thousand times ten millons of world aeons (śatasahasrakoṭikalpa).I have to
give an offering from this pavillion”, and he carried on the palm of his hand a lotus with
a hundred thousand petals made of pure gold.Then he jumped down from the pavillion, and by
the power of the Buddha (buddhānubhāva) he sat down in the air.Then the boy Ratnadatta offered
the lotus, made of pure gold and with a hundred thousand petals, to the Lord; and as
soon as it was out of the hands of the boy, the Lord made it into a lotus parasol in the
space over his head and spread out a net of jewels.
