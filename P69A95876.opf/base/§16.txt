(On the designation bodhi and the instruction of the bodhisattva in the beginning of his development:)
Then the bodhisattva Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta spoke to the boy Ratnadatta:Boy, of what
is “awakening” a designation (bodhir iti dāraka kasyaitad adhivacanam)?Ratnadatta said:
Mañjuśrī, awakening is no designation (ratnadatta uvāca nāsti mañjuśrīr bodhir adhivacanam).Mañjuśrī
said: Thinking what (yataś cintayitvā) do you say so?Ratnadatta said: Mañjuśrī,
the nature of things is unthinkable (dharmatā mañjuśrīr acintyā), thinking thus I will teach
about it (sā mayaivaṃ cintayitvā nirdeśyā).Mañjuśrī said: But what kind of instruction
will you teach, how will you instruct the bodhisattva in the beginning of his development
(atra katham ādikarmikasya bodhisattvasyāvavādo nirdeśyaḥ katham anuśāsanīyaḥ)?Ratnadatta
said: One should speak like this – do not give up your passion (rāga), do not fight your
aversion (dveṣa), do not clear away your bewilderment (moha), do not liberate (uccal-) yourself
from your body (kāya), practise (car-) the bad things (akuśala), do not hold back (nigrah-)
your views (dṛṣṭi), do not be conscious of the bonds [to the worldly things] (sāyojana),
grasp for (parigrah-) the parts of the personality (skandha), amass (piṇḍīkṛ-) the
spheres of sense-perception (dhātu), move about (car-) among the fields of sense-perception
(āyatana), do not leave (atî-) the stage of fools (bālabhūmi), frequent (āgam-) the bad
(akuśala), give up the good (kuśala), do not think of (manaskṛ-) the Buddha, do not reflect
(cint-) on religious teachings (dharma), do not give offerings to (pūj-) the congregation
of monks (sāgha), do not take the training (śikṣā) upon yourself (samādā-), do not seek
(prārthaya-) the peacefulness of existence (bhavaśamana), do not cross over (uttṛ-) the river
[of existence] (ogha). This kind of instructions one should teach and give to the bodhisattva
in the beginning of his development (ādikarmika).Why? Because this state of the moments
of existence and nothing else is their [true] state (iyaṃ dharmāṇāṃ dharmasthitir shitir
eva).Foolish people (bāla) explain things (vyākṛ-) in accordance with moments of existence
of arising (utpādadharma) and moments of existence of disappearance (nirodhadharma).
But this sphere of all moments of existence distinguishes itself by being beyond thought-constructions
(sa tu dharmadhātur nirvikalpaprabhāvitaḥ), and understanding the essential
character of all these moments of existence in this way is awakening (ya eṣāṃ dharmāṇāṃ svabhāvasyaivamanubodhaḥ
sā bodhir iti).If he is taught in this way and does not become afraid,
scared or terrified, then he is a bodhisattva not turning back in his development, one
who has a part in the stage of never turning back (yady evam upadiṣṭo nottrasen na sātrasyen
na sātrāsam āpadyeta sa vatāvaivartiko bodhisattvo ’vaivairtikabhūmibhāgīya iti jñātavyaḥ).By
means of this instruction one should carry on a pleasant conversation at length (anenāvavādena
punaḥ punaḥ sāmodanīyam).
