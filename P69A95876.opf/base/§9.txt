(Verses on the meaning (artha) of making an offering:) Then the boy Ratnadatta spoke the following
verses:

When I offer this lotus to the Lord I do not wish anything in particular. Rather, in taking
away all meaning (sarvārthopacchedanāya), I seek the ultimate awakening (varabodhi) (1).In
accordance with the fact that in the unborn (anutpanna) awakening there is no attainment
or loss, no accepting or giving away, I am giving this lotus (2).As for the meaning (artha)
constructed (kalpita) by ignorant people (bāla), this construct (kalpita) is at least not
the meaning. Rather, I give this offering to the supreme person (varapudgala) to take away
all constructions (sarvakalpacchedanāya) (3).Thus this flower offering will give me no
maturing fruit (vipākaphala). Rather, I give this offering to take away all substances (sarvavastucchedanāya)
(4).In my Buddha-land (buddhakṣetra) only the victorious supreme way (jinavarayāna)
will be followed, the words śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha are even not mentioned
(5).
