(The Lord relates Ratnadatta’s earlier lives:) Then the venerable Śāriputra asked the Lord:How
long, Lord, has the boy Ratnadatta practised this teaching?The Lord said: At the time the
Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara gave me the prophecy of awakening (vyākaraṇa), when I had reached the
kind of tolerance that all moments of existence are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣāntipratilabdha),
at that time this boy was the greatest of the bodhisattvas established in emptiness
(śūnyatāpratiṣṭhita), according to the words of Dīpaṃkara. And at the time I was one for
the first time to produce the thought of incomparable perfect awakening (anuttarāyai samyaksaṃbodhaye
prathamacittotpādika), at that time three hundred thousand kalpas had elapsed
since this boy attained that tolerance (kṣāntipratilambha).Śāriputra said: But Lord, what
is the cause (hetu), what is the reason (pratyaya) why this boy Ratnadatta has not reached
the incomparable perfect awakening?The Lord said: Ask the boy himself, he will tell you.
