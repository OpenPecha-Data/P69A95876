(Being asked by Maudgalyāyana, verses by Ratnadatta on true and conventional learning, and the
empty identity of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa:) Maudgalyāyana said:

As for your age, you are very young, but you are like an ocean by your insight (prajñā)! How
long have you been trained (śikṣita) in these teachings (dharma) (1)?Ratnadatta said:All
my learning (śikṣā) has disappeared, because what is learning is really not learning: That
in which there is no learning is the learning of the wise (1).The topics (artha) on which
you have asked me are all within the common concepts of any being (sattvasaṃjñā). In this
[teaching, however,] no origination (utpāda) is found among any moments of existence anywhere
(2).The foolish (bāla) construct (kalpayanti) awakening (bodhi) and existence (saṃsāra),
but how can you, the reverend monk (bhadanta), admit the teachings of the foolish (bāladharma)
(3)?The wise do not construct (na kalpayanti kuśalāḥ) questions like “How long?”
“How short?”, since moments of existence have no age: this is the way one should understand
them (4).̌“Foolish (bāla)”, “teachings of the foolish (bāladharma)”, “teachings of the Buddha
(buddhadharma)” or “The Victorious (jina)”, the wise (dhīmat) do not make such distinctions.
You should rather see such things as part of emptiness (śūnyatā) (5).̌“The great
sage (maharṣi) attained Awakening (bodhi)”, this is an illogical construction (ayuktakalpanā):
since there is no origination (utpāda) among the moments of existence, how can there
be an extinction (nirvāṇa) to be obtained (6).The moments of existence are endless (ananta),
the Lord has said, and a liberated (vimukta) being is inexistent (abhāva). So do understand
that there is no difference between existence and extinction (7)!Among all these forms
there is no increase or decrease, the wise are not deluded (na muhyante) by the moments
of existence without distinctions (aprabhinna) (8).The foolish believe they have attained
and found, the foolish believe they have attained extinction (nirvāṇa): they are rather passionately
attached to existence (saṃsārasārakta), conceited thinking (manyanā) is the snare
of the Evil One (mārabandhana) [which binds them] (9).One thinking “I have attained” has
not attained anything, he has rather succumbed to the ignorance (avidyā) by which he goes
to new rebirths (punarbhava) (10).After one is placed on the seat of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa)
there are no viewpoints (dṛṣṭi) and nothing more to get rid of. And this awakening (bodhi)
of the Buddhas is only a conventional expression (vyavahāra) without meaning (anartha)
(11).It is impossible to express the awakening (bodhi) and extinction (saṃsāra) with conventional
expressions (vyavahāra): Those viewing things this way discern (vijānanti) the true
state of things (dharmatā) (12).
