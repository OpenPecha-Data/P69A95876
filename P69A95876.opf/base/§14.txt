(Why Ratnadatta has not attained awakening:) Then the venerable Śāriputra addressed the boy
Ratnadatta (athāyuṣmāñ śāriputro ratnadattaṃ dārakam āmantrayate sma):Why have you then not
reached the incomparable complete awakening (tvaṃ kasya hetor anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau
nābhisaṃbuddhaḥ)?Ratnadatta answered: I do not have any conceptions of an incomparable perfect
awakening, that is why I do not wake up (ratnadatta uvāca anuttarasamyaksaṃbodher anupalambhāt
tasmād nāham abhisaṃbuddhye).Śāriputra said: But this Tathāgata, after his perfect
awkening, does not behave according to such conceptions, does he (kiṃ tu tathāgato ’yam
abhisaṃbuddhaḥ mopalambhe caret)?Ratnadatta said: If the Tathāgata grasps at [the idea
of] complete awakening (yadi tathāgato ’bhisaṃbodhiṃ gṛhṇīyāt?), he is one who is possessed
of conceptions (upalambha), and so he does not wake up, he does not renounce (nābhisaṃbudhyeta
na prajahyād), such is the teaching (iti dharmavacanāt?).Śāriputra said: How far have
you reached in progress in the four qualities (caturdharmapratipatti) and in tolerance
(kṣānti) by means of maturing your sense of universal sameness (paripakvasamatayā)?The boy
Ratnadatta said: I do not see even one quality completed, so how can there be question of
four (ratnadatto dāraka uvāca nāham ekaṃ dharmam api pariniṣpannaṃ samanupaśyāmi kaḥ punar
vādaś caturaḥ)? But, now, what is accumulating religious progress (atra katamaḥ samudānayaḥ)?
[It is understanding that] religious proclamation is [only] a conception (dharmavijñaptir
ity ayam upalambhaḥ), awakening is [only] a conception (bodhir ity ayam upalambhaḥ),
that the Tathāgata is [only] grasping [for something inexistent] (tathāgata ity ayam parigrahaḥ),
that liberation is only a rhetorical figure (mokṣa ity ayaṃ prapañcaḥ).
