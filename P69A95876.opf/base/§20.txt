(Ratnadatta’s imperishable offering:) Then the boy Ratnadatta said to his nurse: Nurse, give
me some food so that I can give an offering to the Lord!Then the boy Ratnadatta’s nurse filled
a bronze vessel with food of eight tastes and gave it to the boy Ratnadatta, and the
boy Ratnadatta said to the Lord:Lord, as long as the whole of this congregation of monks
is not satisfied with the truth which is the truth of the imperishability of all moments of
existence (sarvadharmākṣayatāsatya), there will be no decrease of what is in this bronze
vessel!Then, after filling the almsbowl of the Lord, the boy Ratnadatta said to the congregations
of monks: Venerables, he who out of compassion (anukampām upādāya) for me will accept
these alms (piṇḍapāta) which will bring me great fruit (bṛhatphala), he who will not
purify the gift by his body (yo na dakṣiṇāṃ kāyena viśodhayati), who will not purify the gift
with his thought (yo na cittena viśodhayati), when to whom it is given there is no merit
(puṇya) or maturing result (vipāka), for whom there is no action (karman) by body, speech
or mind, who does not cling to the unconditioned (saṃskṛta), who is not sullied by the
qualities of the ordinary person (pṛthagjanadharmānupalipta), not dependent on the qualities
of the disciple (śrāvakadharmānāśrita), he who has not started on the way of the Buddha
(buddhayānāniryāta), who wishes not to start on the way of the Buddha, may he receive it!
After this no one from the congregations of monks received the vessel.Then the boy Ratnadatta
said: As for me, I wish to give, and you wish to eat, and I have no expectations whatsoever
(niṣpratikāṅkṣa) to the venerables, so accept!The splendour of qualities of the buddha-fields
(buddhakṣetraguṇavyūha) of a hundred thousand times ten million bodhisattvas of
the greatness of Mañjuśrī, a hundred thousand times ten million times greater than this will
be the qualities of my buddha-field!By this truth (satya), by the truth in this word of
truth (satyavacana), by this word of truth, may the almsbowls of all of you be filled from
this bronze vessel, and may the bronze vessel never be exhausted (parikṣi-)!Then the almsbowls
of the monks in all those congregations were filled, and as many were the crowds of
inhabitants in that city, all of them were satisfied by the boy Ratnadatta with food having
eight tastes. But the alms were not consumed (na kṣīṇa).
