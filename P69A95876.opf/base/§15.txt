(On the lack of meaning in becoming a monk:) Śāriputra said:It is wonderful (āścarya), son of
good family (kulaputra), in practising such teachings (dharma) you are born in the nearness
of the Buddhas through miraculous birth (aupapāduka), and will always assume the life
of a monk (sadā pravrajasi).

Then the boy Ratnadatta spoke these verses:

Birth (utpāda) and non-birth (utpāda), the two [concepts] are only discursive thinking (prapañca),
the region of thought-constructions (saṃkalpabhūmi), the territory of the Evil One
(māragocara): grasping for the moments of existence related to the body, etc. (kāyādidharmaparigraha)
is only conceited thoughts (manyanā), in which gods of passion (kāmadeva) and
pride (asura) are lost (1).Some think: The Victorious (jina) has attained the unconditioned
(asaṃskṛta) ambrosia (amṛta), but those who think like that, believe they have themselves
clothed the Buddha; what they have attained is not what the leaders [of religion] (nāyaka)
have attained (2).Here many people, having become monks (pravrajya), are conceited by the
fact that they are monks (pravrajyāṃ manyante), they are really bewildered (vibhramya)
by mental conceptions (cittopalambha) and are corrupting the religious teachings (nirdeśadūṣaka)
(3).They say: I have attained the ambrosia, but they speak as someone attaining only
conceitedness (māna). But in the teachings (nirdeśa) of our protector (trāyin), the lion
of the Śākya clan, there is no discursive thinking (prapañca) (4).They do not understand
the real nature of thought (cittasvabhāva) in all the aspects of thought, and thus [they do
not understand that] the viewpoint (dṛṣṭi) of our teacher (vināyaka) is without any real
nature (niḥsvabhāva) (5).Because the viewpoint (dṛṣṭi) proclaimed by the Victorious One (jina)
with the pure eye [of wisdom] (viśuddhacakṣur), there is really no view (dṛṣṭir nāsti).
And that is why the wise (prajñāvat) do not hold on to a view like “I am liberated” (nāhaṃ
mukta iti grāhaḥ) (6).Those who do meditation in grasping for distinguishing marks (nimittagrāhabhāvita)
become bewildered (muhyante) by conceptions of themselves (ātmopalambha),
thus some unwise people (akuśala) reject emptiness (śūnyatā) calling it inexistence (abhāva)
(7).Existent things (bhāva) are like a dream, an illusion (svapnamāyāsadṛśa). But having
constructed (kalpayitvā) existence in their thoughts (matinā), these unwise people (akuśala)
call it extinction (nirvāṇa), when things existent (bhāva) have disappeared (naṣṭa)
(8).Rather, when they base themselves on the body, their [true] concept of morality (śīlasaṃjñā)
is destroyed (vinaṣṭa), and by mental conceptions (cittopalambha), their [true]
concept of meditation (dhyānasaṃjñā) is destroyed (vinaṣṭa) (9);and in the same way, by conceptions
of what insight is (prajñopalambha), the concept of their true potentiality (bījasaṃjñā)
is confused (vimūḍha). Because they really are only clever in the ways of the world
(lokalaukikakuśala) such people should rather be called thiefs of religion (dharmacaura)
(10).In all these moments of existence (dharma) is found the undefiled light (asākliṣṭaprabhāsvara)
of true reality (dharmadhātu), so what can you tell me of the meaning of assuming
a monk’s life (pravrajyārtha) (11)?All moments of existence are without difference (nānātva),
they are like an echo (pratiśrutkā). The wise people never make thought-constructions
(na kalpayanti) concerning the field of the saints (āryagocara) (12).In the moments of
existence (dharma), which have the essential character of not being anything else but what
they are (ananyalakṣaṇa), being what they are (tathatā), not being in another way than they
are (ananyathā), being without change (nirvikāra), what is the use of constructing the
assuming of a monk’s life (pravrajyākalpanā) (13)?
