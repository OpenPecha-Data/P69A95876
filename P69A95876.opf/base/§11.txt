(Dialogue between Ratnadatta and Mahāmaudgalyāyana on the ontological status of bodhi and tathāgata:)
Then the venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana addressed himself to the boy Ratnadatta:But,
my boy, has not the Tathāgata realized the incomparable perfectly complete awakening, does
he not teach religion (kathaṃ dāraka tathāgato nānuttarāyāṃ samyaksambodhāv abhisaṃbuddho
na dharmaṃ deśayati sma)?Ratnadatta answered: the wise should not make awakening the object
of discursive thoughts (na paṇḍitena bodhiḥ prapañcayitavyā) or construct the Tathāgata
by his conceited thoughts (na ca tathāgato manyitavyaḥ),he should not make construction
as “moments of existence do not arise” (na dharmaṃ notpadyanta iti kalpayitavyam),he should
not make construction as “all moments of existence are composite” (na sarvadharmāḥ saṃskṛtā
iti kalpayitavyam),he should not make construction as “all moments of existence are non-composite”
(na sarvadharmā asaṃskṛtā iti kalpayitavyam),he should not make construction
as “being born and unbornness (utpādānutpāda)”, “existent and non-existent (bhāvābhāva)”,
“grasping and giving up (heyopadeya)”, “connection and disconnection (saṃyogaviyoga)”, “going
and coming (gatyāgati)”, “remaining and changing existence (sthiticyuti)”, “states of
desire, dislike or bewilderment (rāgadharmadveṣadharmamohadharma)”,he should not make constructions
like “truth or untruth” (na dharmādharma iti kalpayitavyam).̌“Because of ignorance
(avidyā) there is birth (upapatti) in the states of ordinary men, disciples, isolated
buddhas (pṛthagjanadharmaśrāvakadharmapratyekabuddhadharmabuddhadharma), in impure and pure
states (saṃkliṣṭadharmavyavadātadharma), in states of forms (rūpin), without form (ārūpya),
with or without conceptual thinking (saṃjñyasaṃjñin), with or without essential character
(lakṣaṇālakṣaṇa), of pure conduct (pariśuddhacaryā), where things are seen as universally
equal or non-equal (samatāsamatā), in body (kāya), mind (citta), where all things are
fundamentally understood or not fundamentally understood (sarvadharmayoniśo’yoniśaḥ)”, such
constructions he should not make (iti na kalpayitavyam).So what do you mean, Maudgalyāyana,
has the Tathāgata realized the incomparable perfectly complete awakening (tat kiṃ manyase
maudgalyāyana tathāgato nānuttarāyāṃ samyaksambodhāv abhisaṃbuddhaḥ)?Maudgalyāyana answered:
Well then, [according to what you have said] he cannot have (uvāca no hīdam).Ratnadatta
said: But can it be accepted that the Tathāgata is not included in things as they are,
that awakening is not included in things as they are, that an ordinary being is not included
in things as they are (uvāca kiṃ tu na tathāgatas tathatāntargato na bodhis tathatāntargatā
na pṛthagjanas tathatāntargata iṣyante)?Maudgalyāyana answered: No, it can also not
be [accepted that he is not included in things as they are] (maudgalyāyana uvāca no hīdam).Ratnadatta
said: Maybe you foster discursive thinking about what is beyond discursive thought
(ratnadatto dāraka uvāca tvaṃ maudgalyāyana niṣprapañcaṃ prapañcayasi)?Maudgalyāyana
answered: As for me, I teach by means of conventions [understood by] the world (maudgalyāyana
uvaca ahaṃ tu lokasaṃvṛtyā deśayāmi).The boy said: Maudgalyāyana, the world has the form
of nothing but untruth, deception and illusion (mṛṣāmoṣamāyākāra), and it deceives only
the foolish (bāla).Maudgalyāyana said: If the world consists only of states of untruth and
deception, then also this teaching of yours must be untruth and deception. So why do you
then teach it (maudgalyāyana uvāca sacel loko mṛṣāmoṣadharmā ayaṃ ca nirdeśo ’pi mṛṣāmoṣadharmaṃ
tvaṃ kasmād deśayasi)?Ratnadatta said: Since all moments of existence cannot be definitely
be pointed out, they cannot be demonstrated, or have a conclusion reached about
them (uvāca sarve dharmā maudgalyāyanānidarśanā na te pratipādyāḥ prāpyāś ca).Thus they can
also not be realized, abandoned, fully known or cultivated in meditation (na sākṣātkartavyā
na prahātavyā na parijñeyā na bhāvayitavāḥ).Maudgalyāyana said: But for what reason do
you make an offering to the Tathāgata (maudagalyāyana uvāca atha tvaṃ yadarthaṃ tathāgataṃ
pūjayasi)?The boy said: Maudgalyāyana, are you the Tathāgata? Are you the giver of the offering?
Or are you one fostering all kinds of conceptions on giving (dāraka uvāca tvaṃ maudgalyāyana
tathāgato vā dātā vā dānam vopalabhase)?To this the venerable Maudgalyāyana had
nothing to say (athāyuṣmān maudgalyāyanas tūṣṇīṃbabhūva).The boy Ratnadatta said: Thinking
in this way, Maudgalyāyana, I have completely given up becoming a Tathāgata – those fostering
the attitude found in the way of diciples have in fact not attained much (ratnadatto
dāraka uvāca mayā maudgalyāyana tataś cintayitvā tathāgato bhavituṃ parivarjitam. ye śrāvakayāne
cittāny utpādayanti lābhā te durlabdhā iti).
