(Sons of gods praising the teaching:) Then those sons of gods (devaputra) heard those prophecies,
and, with eighty thousand others went to the place where the Lord was staying, and sprinkled
divine flowers (divyapuṣpa) all over the city of Vaiśālī.All of them were overjoyed
by this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya), saying: Lord, we are so happy, and we pray
that you will disseminate this way of awakening (bodhinaya) of the Tathāgatas.In the moment
of their happiness they became [bodhisattvas] never turning back (avaivartika) from
the incomparable perfect awakening,and eighty-four thousand beings in Vaiśālī became [bodhisattvas]
never turning back (avaivartika) from the incomparable perfect awakening.Twelve
thousand developed a pure sight for the moments of existence, without impurities (virajo vigatamalaṃ
dharmeṣu dharmacaṣkṣur viśuddham).
